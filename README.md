This is a basic CV template which can easily switch between English and German language. The aim was to have a nice, clean and easy template for a fast adoption of the CV for different occasions or if some points change. I don't like the fancy, colourful CV packages available, so I decided to make my own.

If you like to make use of it, adapt it or extend it, feel free to do so.

To use the template, the personal details can easily be entered in the place-holder values. To change the language (the default is English), simply exchange the position of *ngerman* and *english* when including the babel package. To enter your content, just do so under the respective point in either the English or the German part.
